Here I implemented algorithm developed by Hopcroft and Karp in 1971 that checks the equality of two finite automaton.

With help of Makefile you can create "runHK" executable.

and with "./runHK input1.txt input2.txt" command you can check if FAs defined in input1.txt and input2.txt are equal or not

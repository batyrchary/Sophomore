This is basic implementation of simple text-editor.

With help of makefile you can create "hw1" executable.

with "./hw1 --record file.out"  you can record the operations that you performed to file.out
and with
"./hw1 --replay file.out"
you can replay it.

Also detailed explanation of problem is provided in HW1.pdf file.

And there exist tester for the solution in tester.zip, by extracting the files from it and by executing tester.py with command: 	"python tester.py" you can test it.
